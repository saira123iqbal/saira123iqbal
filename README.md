ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm saira iqbal

ðŸŽ“ I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science at FAST NUCES, where my passion for technology is fueled by an immersive academic environment.

ðŸš€ Outside the world of coding, I am an avid participant in social events, leveraging every opportunity to connect, learn, and contribute. My commitment to community engagement extends beyond the screen, as I believe in the power of collaboration to drive meaningful change.

ðŸŽ¨ When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me expressing myself through the strokes of a paintbrush or lending my voice to a melody. Painting and singing are not just hobbies for me; they are vital outlets for creativity and personal expression.

ðŸŒŸ Join me on this coding journey, where innovation meets artistry, and let's create something extraordinary together!
